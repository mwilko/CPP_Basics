Today is Sunday.
Today is Sunday.
Today is Sunday.
 For the first time they took me out into the sun today.
 For the first time they took me out into the sun today.
 For the first time they took me out into the sun today.
 And for the first time in my life I was aghast,
 And for the first time in my life I was aghast,
 And for the first time in my life I was aghast,
 that the sky is so far away,
 that the sky is so far away,
 that the sky is so far away,
 and so blue,
 and so blue,
 and so blue,
 and so vast! 
 and so vast! 
 and so vast!
