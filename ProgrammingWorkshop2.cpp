// In this homework, you will implement a program that
// generates a summary of a given document (this could be based on the work from Task 1).
// The summary will include the number of sentences, the number of words, and the
// frequency of each word in the document. For this purpose, you are required to use built-in
// types, vectors/arrays, and control structures to implement this task. The use of functions is
// encouraged. This task will be assessed during the workshop session..
